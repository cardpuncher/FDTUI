Changelog:

  0.2 (09-24-2018): Disabled menuitem foreground color have changed to grey on
                    "FDOSTUI.INI". But, it seems red. (Possible another
                    bug.) Changed default is showing archive items to enabled
                    and showing readonly items to enabled. Fixed popup input
                    of run command not cancelling bug. Add pause to ending to
                    running command. Fixed newline bug of some files.

  0.1 (07-13-2018): Create first version.
